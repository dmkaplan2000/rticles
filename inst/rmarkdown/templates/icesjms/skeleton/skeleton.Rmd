# Introduction

This template is based on the ICES JMS LaTeX template available [here](https://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/icesjms/document/ices.zip?node=cbc38f68ad59f533a74f&version=78208:3c41d291739046ec1368), which is in turn based on the `ouparticle.cls` style from Oxford University Press. The original ICES JMS/OUP sample tex document, providing more details on preferred formatting for LaTeX documents, is included with the template in the file `ices_sample.tex`.

# Materials and methods

An equation with a label for cross-referencing:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq1}
\int^{r_2}_0 F(r,\varphi){\rm d}r\,{\rm d}\varphi = [\sigma r_2/(2\mu_0)]
\int^{\infty}_0\exp(-\lambda|z_j-z_i|)\lambda^{-1}J_1 (\lambda r_2)J_0
(\lambda r_i\,\lambda {\rm d}\lambda)
\end{equation}

This equation can be referenced as follows: Eq. \ref{eq:eq1}

## A subsection

A numbered list:

1) First point
2) Second point
    - Subpoint
    
A bullet list:

* First point
* Second point

## Citations

Here are two sample citations, the first in "author (year)" format, the second in "(author, year)" format: @Feynman1963118 showed many things. This result is well known [@Dirac1953888]. Bibliography will appear at the end of the document.

# Results

## Generate a figure.

```{r fig1, fig.cap="This is the first figure.",echo=TRUE}
plot(1:10,main="Some data",xlab="Distance (cm)",ylab="Time (hours)")
```

You can reference this figure as follows: Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}.

```{r fig2, fig.cap="This is the second figure.",echo=TRUE}
plot(1:5,pch=19,main="Some data",xlab="Distance (cm)",ylab="Time (hours)")
```

Reference to second figure: Fig. \ref{fig:fig2}

## Generate a table using `xtable`

```{r tab1, results="asis", echo=TRUE}
df = data.frame(ID=1:3,code=letters[1:3])

# Creates tables that follow OUP guidelines using xtable
library(xtable) 
print(xtable(df,caption="This is the table caption",label="tab:tab1"),
      comment=FALSE)
```

You can reference this table as follows: Table \ref{tab:tab1}.

## Generate a table using `kable`

```{r anothertable, echo=TRUE}
df = data.frame(ID=1:3,code=letters[1:3])

# kable can alse be used for creating tables
knitr::kable(df,caption="This is the table caption",format="latex",
             booktabs=TRUE,label="tab2")
```

You can reference this table as follows: Table \ref{tab:tab2}.

# Discussion

You can cross-reference sections and subsections as follows: Section \ref{materials-and-methods} and Section \ref{a-subsection}.

***Note:*** the last section in the document will be used as the section title for the bibliography.
